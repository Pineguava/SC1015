# SC1015 Data Science Mini-Project

Our team's objective is to utilise the data sets of Video games from year 1980 - year 2017 to predict the Global Sales of a certain game in that period. Our Video Games data sets consists of Game related information such as Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre,Publisher, NA Sales, EU Sales, JP Sales, Other Sales and Global Sales.  

In our models, we will be focusing specifically on predicting Global Sales. All together, we will be focsuing on the three commonly used Machine Learning Algorithms in Python which are Linear Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regression.

### Jupyter Notebook #1: Data Extraction & Data Cleaning

  Remarks: In this section, we will be focusing on the extraction and data cleaning of our Video Games dataset. In our data cleaning, we cleaned out those data that              has na values. Next, we extract the outliers of our data based on Global Sales and dropped them as well.
  
### Jupyter Notebook #2: Data Visualization & Exploratory Analysis

  Remarks: In this section, we will be focusing on the data visualization and exploratory analysis of our Video Games dataset. We can see some interesting trends from            our datasets regarding their Genre, Publisher, Platform and Year.  
  
### Jupyter Notebook #3: Machine Learning - Regression (Linear)

  Remarks: In this section, we will be focusing on utilising the Linear Regression model for our Video Games dataset. We split our data according to their train and              test sets and constructed a Linear model based on our train datasets. We analyzed the model and calculated their explained variance(R squared) for both                train and test sets.   

### Jupyter Notebook #4: Machine Learning - Regression (GradientBoosting)

  Remarks: In this section, we will be focusing on utilising the Gradient Boosting Regression model for our Video Games dataset. We split our data according to           their train and test sets and constructed a Gradient Boosting Regression model based on our train datasets. We analyzed the model and calculated their explained                variance(R squared) for both train and test sets.

### Jupyter Notebook #5: Machine Learning - Regression (Random Forest)

  Remarks: In this section, we will be focusing on utilising the Random Forest model for our Video Games dataset. We split our data according to their                            train and test sets and constructed a Random Forest model based on our train datasets. We analyzed the model and calculated their explained                               variance(R squared) for both train and test sets.
